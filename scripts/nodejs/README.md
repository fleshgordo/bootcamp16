## Relaying (bridging) OSC data from nodejs to websockets

# Installation (should install all dependencies based on packages.json):
npm install

# first make sure your OSC client is sending data, here's a simple example (sending to localhost on port 5005)
~~~~
python3 osc_client.py

Make sure you are serving the current directory through a small webserver
~~~~
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
~~~~

Now start the nodejs script from the terminal
~~~~
node OSC2websocket.js
~~~~

Fire up web browser and enter URL
~~~~
http://localhost:8080

Open web inspector and look into the console output
